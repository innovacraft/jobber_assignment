# Project Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details of a data pipeline designed to process and integrate data from two sources: `customer_data.parquet` and `sales_data.csv`. The objective is to provide a consolidated dataset in an Open Table Format (Delta Lake) that is optimized for query performance and ready for analytical consumption.

## High-Level Design

### Architecture
The pipeline architecture is built to manage large volumes of data efficiently and effectively, ensuring scalability, availability, and security:

- **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)**: Data is extracted from S3, transformed using Spark, and loaded into Delta Lake.
- **Enrichment and Extension**: Data is enhanced with additional computations to provide a richer semantic layer for easier analysis.
- **Mitigation of Risks**: Implementing Delta Lake ensures a single source of truth and data consistency across transactions.
- **Scalability and Availability**: Leveraging cloud services and scalable resources to handle varying loads and ensure data availability.
- **Security**: Utilizing AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access and ensure data security.
- **Orchestration and Workflow**: Automated workflows using Apache Airflow to manage the pipeline’s lifecycle and handle dependencies.
- **Monitoring**: Tools like AWS CloudWatch and Spark UI are integrated to monitor pipeline performance and health.

### Technologies Used
- Apache Spark
- AWS S3
- Delta Lake
- Databricks
- Apache Airflow
- AWS IAM
- AWS CloudWatch

## Detailed Steps

### Loading Data
Data is loaded from AWS S3, where raw customer and sales data reside.

### Data Transformation
- Joining sales and customer data on customer IDs.
- Calculating additional metrics such as age groups and total sales.
- Applying transformations to categorize sales into price ranges.

### Data Storage
The transformed data is stored in Delta Lake, optimizing it using ZORDER for efficient querying.

### Query Performance Optimization
- Using Delta Lake’s OPTIMIZE and ZORDER commands to compact files and organize them based on query patterns.

### Data Cleaning
- Applying VACUUM to remove outdated files beyond the retention period, ensuring the storage is clean and efficient.

## Conclusion
This pipeline ensures that the data processed is ready for analytical querying, adhering to best practices in data management and pipeline design, thus enabling the analytics team to derive meaningful insights efficiently.
